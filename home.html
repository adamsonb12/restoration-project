            <p>After being called as a holy prophet and leading his people out of bondage towards safety, 
              in the the book of Exodus, chapter 20, Moses the received the 10 commandments directly from God. 
              God gave the commandments to Moses in order to help Moses guide, govern, and lead his people, 
              who were the house of Israel.
            </p>
            <p>The Ten Commandments given to Moses are as follows: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Thou shalt have no other gods before Me</li>
              <li>Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image</li>
              <li>Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain</li>
              <li>Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy</li>
              <li>Honour thy father and mother</li>
              <li>Thou shalt not kill</li>
              <li>Thou shalt not commit adultery</li>
              <li>Thou shalt not steal</li>
              <li>Thou shalt not bear false witness</li>
              <li>Thou shalt not covet</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These commandments still exist today, and are revered as eternal law in most Christian religions; 
              however, if Moses had existed in our day, charged with teaching and 
              leading modern people today, would those commandments be any different? 
              Moses lived in an ancient time, leading people who had been slaves all their lives to 
              newfound freedom. The people were leaving the great civilization of Egypt, to start 
              fresh and form their own new nation. Their lives, and their circumstances have very 
              little in common with ours today. For christian saints in these latter days, how 
              would God’s revelation of his commandments change, based on his people’s circumstances and time? 
              Of course the ten commandments are a foundation, but God has already built upon his ten commandments, 
              revealing His law for His church to Joseph Smith the prophet. </p>

              <p>Joseph Smith is the founder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. 
                At age 14, he started having revelations from God. As time went on, Joseph received more 
                revelations and was called by God to be His prophet, and to restore His true church. 
                As Joseph continued to build up God’s restored kingdom, he received many more revelations about doctrine, 
                teachings, and various other commandments. Joseph recorded many of these revelations in the Doctrine and 
                Covenants, now regarded as a book of scripture by the LDS church.</p>
              <p>In section 42 of the Doctrine and Covenants, Joseph recorded a revelation he received, 
                where God listed and explained the commandments He wanted His church and His saints to obey. 
                These commandments build upon the ten commandments given in ancient time, and are God’s law today. 
                Members of the LDS church should study these and see them as equals to the ten commandments. 
                All christians should study these commandments and follow them, to draw closer to Christ. </p>

              <p>In February of 1832 in Kirtland, Ohio, Joseph Smith received a revelation, 
                which the Lord referred to as His law. The law given to Joseph was to guide Christ’s church 
                and its members to be a clean and righteous people. The law of the Lord was to be kept and seen 
                equal to the ten commandments given to Moses after fleeing from the land of Egypt. 
                The Lord’s law consisted of 17 commandments:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Thou shalt not kill (vs 18-19)</li>
                <li>Thou shalt not steal (vs 20)</li>
                <li>Thou shalt not lie (vs 21)</li>
                <li>Thou shalt love thy wife with all thy heart, and shalt cleave unto her and none else (vs 22)</li>
                <li>Do not lust after another (vs 23)</li>
                <li>Thou shalt not commit adultery (vs 24-26)</li>
                <li>Thou shalt not speak evil of thy neighbor, nor do him any harm (vs 27)</li>
                <li>Thou wilt remember the poor, and consecrate of thy properties for their support... (vs 30-39)</li>
                <li>Thou shalt not be proud (vs 40)</li>
                <li>Thou shalt not be idle (vs 42)</li>
                <li>Thou shalt live together in love (vs 45)</li>
                <li>Thou shalt stand in the place of thy stewardship (vs 53)</li>
                <li>Thou shalt not take thy brother’s garment; thou shalt pay for that 
                  which thou shalt receive of thy brother (vs 54)</li>
                <li>And if thou obtainest more than that which would be for thy support, 
                  thou shalt give it into my storehouse (vs 55)</li>
                <li>Seek and ask for revelations (vs 56)</li>
                <li>Shalt govern the church according to the law (vs 59)</li>
                <li>Ye shall hereafter receive church covenants (vs 67)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>These commandments should a significant part of the foundation, or the cornerstone of the LDS faith. 
                Unfortunately, many latter-day saints are not even aware of this law, nor of its importance. 
                Each of these commandments should be focused on more in church meetings, discourses, and lessons, because
                they are the laws the Lord wants his children in this day to obey.</p>

                    Heavenly Father will always guide his children through the spirit of revelaiton. 
                    God has done so with his ancient prophets and continues today through his modern-day
                    prophets, which started with Joseph Smith. Although these 17 commandments listed in 
                    D&C 42 are the Lord's law today, the prophets leading the LDS church today continue to 
                    receive more revelations. These revelations are filled with more commandments, teachings, and 
                    more guidance on how we can better obey our Heavenly Father and be righteous children. I testify that 
                    this is true, and urge the reader, regardless of their faith, to listen to God's prophets and 
                    obey the Lord's laws.
